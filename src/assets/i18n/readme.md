# Tutorial for translating the PIA software

First, we would like to thank you for taking an interest in translating the content of the PIA software. To do so, you will need to [login](https://github.com/login?return_to=%2Fjoin%3Fsource%3Dheader-home "Login to your Github Account") to your Github account or [create one](https://github.com/join?source=header-home "Create Github Account") if needed.  

## Creating the translation file
#### Open en.json
![Open en.json](https://framapic.org/OBWmmOmKzU2X/jwhmQzQwzvgY.jpg "Open en.json")
In the [language folder (i18n)](https://github.com/LINCnil/pia/tree/master/src/assets/i18n "Language folder") open the english version [en.json](https://github.com/LINCnil/pia/blob/master/src/assets/i18n/en.json "en.json").
<br><br>

#### Select and copy the file content
![Select and copy file content](https://framapic.org/xJxCBmAWtqKb/Yvu0jzpIrHNL.jpg "Select and copy file content")
Select the text of the whole document and copy it (`ctrl + C` on Window, `cmd + C` on MacOS or `right click + Copy`)
<br><br>

#### Create a new file
![Create new file](https://framapic.org/hgJ3kHszT4GP/aCMBFc1BHQLh.jpg "Create new file")
Go back to the [language folder (i18n)](https://github.com/LINCnil/pia/tree/master/src/assets/i18n "Language folder") and click on "Create new file".
<br><br>

#### Name the new file
![Name file](https://framapic.org/5NSCLkphsclz/el5CioUy0lBy.jpg "ISO 639-1")
Click in the name field and name the file using the following nomenclature: `language-iso-code.json`. You can find the list of the ISO 639-1 standardised nomenclature corresponding to your language on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes "en.json"). For example, the french file is named `"fr.json"` and the english one `"en.json"`.
<br><br>

#### Paste the content you've copied from en.json in the new file
![Paste copied text](https://framapic.org/jCRZt9wNlpME/pDblVKx7NtY7.jpg "Paste copied text")
Paste the text you have previously copied (`ctrl + V` on Window, `cmd + V` on MacOS or `right click + Paste`) in the text area. You are now ready for translating the software!
