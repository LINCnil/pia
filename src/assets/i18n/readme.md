# Tutorial for translating the PIA software

First, we would like to thank you for taking an interest in translating the content of the PIA software. To do so, you will need to [login](https://github.com/login?return_to=%2Fjoin%3Fsource%3Dheader-home "Login to your Github Account") to your Github account or [create one](https://github.com/join?source=header-home "Create Github Account") if needed.  

## Creating the translation file
#### Open en.json
In the [language folder (i18n)](https://github.com/LINCnil/pia/tree/master/src/assets/i18n "Language folder") open the english version [en.json](https://github.com/LINCnil/pia/blob/master/src/assets/i18n/en.json "en.json").
<br><br>

#### Select and copy the file content
Select the text of the whole document and copy it (`ctrl + C` on Window, `cmd + C` on MacOS or `right click + Copy`)
<br><br>

#### Create a new file
Go back to the [language folder (i18n)](https://github.com/LINCnil/pia/tree/master/src/assets/i18n "Language folder") and click on "Create new file" (available on the right side above the array of translation files).
<br><br>

#### Name the new file
Click in the name field and name the file using the following nomenclature: `language-iso-code.json`. You can find the list of the ISO 639-1 standardised nomenclature corresponding to your language on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes "en.json"). For example, the french file is named `"fr.json"` and the english one `"en.json"`.
<br><br>

#### Paste the content you've copied from en.json in the new file
Paste the text you have previously copied (`ctrl + V` on Window, `cmd + V` on MacOS or `right click + Paste`) in the text area. You are now ready for translating the software! 
<br><br><br>

## Translating the file
#### Editing the fields
The texts to translate are __only the ones between quotation marks after the colon__. For example on line 4 of the file you should find the following :<br>
`"subtitle1": "A platform to create <br> and manage your PIAs"`<br>
Only `A platform to create <br> and manage your PIAs` should be translated.
<br><br>

#### Submitting the file
Whenever you want, even if the translation is not finished as you'll be able to edit it afterward, you can send us the translation by clicking on `Propose new file`.
<br><br><br>

## Editing an existing translation
#### Editing a file
Click on the translation file you're interested in contributing to available in the [language folder (i18n)](https://github.com/LINCnil/pia/tree/master/src/assets/i18n "Language folder"). Then click on the pen icon.
<br><br>

#### Editing the fields
The texts to translate are __only the ones between quotation marks after the colon__. For example on line 4 of the file you should find the following :<br>
`"subtitle1": "A platform to create <br> and manage your PIAs"`<br>
Only `A platform to create <br> and manage your PIAs` should be translated.
<br><br>

#### Submitting the file
