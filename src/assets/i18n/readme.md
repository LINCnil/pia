# Tutorial for translating the PIA software

First, we would like to thank you for taking an interest in translating the content of the PIA software.<br>
To do so, you will need to login to your Github account or create one if needed.

## Creating the translation file

#### Open en.json

In the [language folder (i18n)](https://github.com/LINCnil/pia-i18n/tree/main/src/lib/assets/i18n "Language folder") open the english version ([en.json](https://github.com/LINCnil/pia-i18n/blob/main/src/lib/assets/i18n/en.json "en.json")).
<br><br>

#### Select and copy the file content

Select the text of the whole document and copy it (`ctrl + C` on Window, `cmd + C` on MacOS or `right click + Copy`)
<br><br>

#### Create a new file

Go back to the [language folder (i18n)](https://github.com/LINCnil/pia-i18n/tree/main/src/lib/assets/i18n "Language folder") and click on "Create new file".
<br><br>

#### Name the new file

Click in the name field and name the file using the following nomenclature: `language-iso-code.json`. You can find the list of the ISO 639-1 standardised nomenclature corresponding to your language on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes "en.json"). For example, the french file is named `"fr.json"` and the english one `"en.json"`.
<br><br>

#### Paste the content you've copied from en.json in the new file

Paste the text you have previously copied (`ctrl + V` on Window, `cmd + V` on MacOS or `right click + Paste`) in the text area. You are now ready for translating the software!
<br><br><br>

## Translating the file

#### Editing the fields

Texts to translate are the ones **between quotation marks after the colon**.

Click on the translation file you're interested in contributing to available in the [language folder (i18n)](https://github.com/LINCnil/pia-i18n/tree/main/src/lib/assets/i18n "Language folder"). Then click on the pen icon.
