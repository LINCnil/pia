<h2>Manage your PIA</h2>

<p>
  Through the dashboard, you can manage globally all of your PIA by allowing you to do several actions such as duplicate or export a PIA.
</p>

Regarding the measures, you can only enter the ones previously saved in the section "Planned or existing measures". If you wish to add a new measure, you should do it in the aforementioned section. To indicate the risk severity and likelihood, slide the cursor on the gauge to the corresponding estimated level. You also have to justify this estimation according to the elements previously entered.

<h2>Evaluate a PIA</h2>

<p>
  Second step of the PIA, the evaluation will be carried out by the DPO together with the CISO. The evaluation can be made on an entire section or each question of a section. Either two or three evaluation options are available.
</p>

<h3>"To correct"</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="./assets/images/help/en/2018-02-23 02 Eval 01 - A corriger.png" alt="">
    </td>
    <td>
      The "to correct" option means that the information provided during the editing phase are not sufficient to be able to be evaluated. By choosing this evaluation, the section will be sent back to editing.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>"Improvable"</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="./assets/images/help/en/2018-02-23 02 Eval 02 - Ameliorable.png" alt="">
    </td>
    <td>
      The "improvable" evaluation means that the information provided during the edition phase are sufficient but some corrective actions has to be taken to improve the conformity or security of the processing. By choosing this evaluation, it is mandatory to describe those corrective actions that will be automatically added to the action plan.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>"Acceptable"</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="./assets/images/help/en/2018-02-23 02 Eval 03 - Acceptable.png" alt="">
    </td>
    <td>

</table>

<h3>DPO and concerned persons opinions</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="./assets/images/help/en/2018-02-23 02 Eval 04 - Avis du DPO.png" alt="">
    </td>
    <td>
      This section allows the DPO to say if the processing should be implemented or not and justify it. This section also allows to indicate if the opinion of the concerned persons has been sought or not and to justify the reasons behind this choice as well as the answers of the concerned persons where required.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Validate a PIA</h2>

<p>
  Final step of the PIA, the validation will be done by the data controller. The risk mapping and the action plan are two tools to help him quickly understand the risks associated with his processing and which actions have to be taken to improve it. According to his analysis, he has three ways to validate the PIA.
</p>

<h3>Risk mapping</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="./assets/images/help/en/2018-02-23 03 Validation 01 - Cartographie des risques.png" alt="">
    </td>
    <td>
      The risk mapping visualises the risk evolution according to the corrective actions proposed by the evaluator compared to the existing situation.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Action plan</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="./assets/images/help/en/2018-02-23 03 Validation 02 - Plan Action.png" alt="">
    </td>
    <td>
      The action plan centralises all the corrective actions indicated during the evaluation phase by the evaluator. A visualisation at the top of the page helps to quickly see which measures are to be improved. For each corrective action in the action plan, you can set a due date and a person responsible for its implementation. 
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Reject PIA</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="./assets/images/help/en/2018-02-23 03 Validation 03 - Refus Validation.png" alt="">
    </td>
    <td>
      If you consider the PIA is too risky or incomplete, you can reject it by clicking on "Reject PIA". You should afterward explain the reason for refusing it. You will then be able to either abandon the processing, in which case the PIA will be archived with no possibility to edit it later, or send it back to the evaluator. She will have to take into account the comments of the data controller in order to propose the necessary changes in the PIA.
    </td>
  </tr>

<h3>Approve PIA (signed)</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="./assets/images/help/en/2018-02-23 03 Validation 04 - Validation avec signature.png" alt="">
    </td>
    <td>
      You can approve a PIA by uploading a signed copy of the PIA report in the software. Choose the "Approve PIA (signed)" button, print the report, sign it and add it to the PIA software as an attachment of the considered PIA.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Approve PIA (direct)</h3>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="./assets/images/help/en/2018-02-23 03 Validation 05 - Validation simple.png" alt="">
    </td>
    <td>
      A simplified approval process is available. To use it, click on the "Approve PIA (direct)" button. This validation option should be used for processing similar to ones already approved with a signed approval process.
    </td>
  </tr>
