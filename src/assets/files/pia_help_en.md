## Evaluate a PIA

Second step of the PIA, the evaluation will be carried out by the DPO together with the CISO. The evaluation can be made on an entire section or each question of a section. Either two or three evaluation option are available.

## Validate a PIA 

Final step of the PIA, the validation will be done by the data controller. The risk overview and the risk mapping are two tools to help him quickly understand the risks associated with his processing and which actions have to be taken to improve it. According to his analysis, he has three ways to validate the PIA.
 
### Risk mapping

| | |
| --- | --- |
| ![Logo](../assets/images/help/en/2018-02-23 03 Validation 01 - Cartographie des risques.png) | The risk mapping visualises the risk evolution according to the corrective actions proposed by the evaluator compared to the existing situation. |

### Action plan

| | |
| --- | --- |
| ![Logo](../assets/images/help/en/2018-02-23 03 Validation 02 - Plan Action.png) | The action plan centralises all the corrective actions indicated during the evaluation phase by the evaluator. A visualisation at the top of the page helps to quickly understand which the points to improve in the processing are. For each corrective actions in the action plan, you can set a due date and a person responsible for implementing it. |

### Reject PIA

| | |
| --- | --- |
| ![Logo](../assets/images/help/en/2018-02-23 03 Validation 03 - Refus Validation.png) | If you consider the PIA is too risky or incomplete, you can reject it by clicking on "Reject PIA". You should afterward explain the reason for refusing it. You will then be able to either abandon the processing, in which case the PIA will be archived with no possibility to edit it later, or send it back to the evaluator. She will have to take into account the comments of the data controller in order to propose the necessary changes in the PIA. |

### Approve PIA (signed)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| ![Logo](../assets/images/help/en/2018-02-23 03 Validation 04 - Validation avec signature.png) | You can approve a PIA by uploading a signed copy of the PIA report in the software. Choose the "Approve PIA (signed)" button, print the report, sign it and add it to the PIA software as an attachment of the considered PIA. |

### Approve PIA (direct)

| ![Logo](../assets/images/help/en/2018-02-23 03 Validation 05 - Validation simple.png) | A simplified approval process is available. To use it, click on the "Approve PIA (direct)" button. This validation option should be used for processing similar to ones already approved with a signed approval process. |
